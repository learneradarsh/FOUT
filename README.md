# FOUT

FOUT ensures that fonts are loaded in a way that doesnâ€™t block the rendering of your webpage, minimizes layout shifts, and enhances page load performance. Fonts are often one of the main culprits for slow page rendering, causing a phenomenon known as flash of unstyled text or flash of invisible text. Optimizing font loading is crucial for improving both the user experience and Core Web Vitals.
